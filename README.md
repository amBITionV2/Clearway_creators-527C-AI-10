Toxicity & Hate Speech Filter â€“ A Smart Browser Plugin            
Online spaces are increasingly facing challenges from pervasive toxicity. This aggressive communication style severely impacts user well-being and erodes the quality of digital communities. We must move beyond reactive moderation.
Over 70% of social media users regularly encounter abusive or hateful comments, leading to a degraded user experience and platform exodus.
Toxic comments fuel harassment, contribute to mental health issues, and create a hostile online culture that discourages participation from diverse voices.
Current platform moderation is often delayed or inconsistent, meaning harm occurs before content is reviewed or removed, leaving vulnerable users exposed.
